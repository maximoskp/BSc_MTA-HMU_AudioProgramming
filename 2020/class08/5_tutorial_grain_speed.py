CAUTION
- make sure you understand how linspace works
- keep in mind that pitch alteration, using this technique, means length alteration
- this technique is usefull in the context of granular synthesis
- applying this technique for pitch shifitng larger audio segments without
  altering their size is possible, by splitting it in smaller overlapping
  grains and applying pitch shifting to them
