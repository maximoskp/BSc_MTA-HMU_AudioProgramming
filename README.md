1) Using Git
1. Create a folder for all your repositories - make sure you know how to navigate there. E.g. create the directory "repos" in "Documents" - full path would be: Documents/repos (assuming you're in the home folder of the current user).

2. Only for the first time you need to get the files in a particular computer, use clone.
-- 2.1 If in windows, open the "Git Bash", else open a terminal and navigate to the repos folder (e.g. type "cd Documents/repos").
-- 2.2 Clone the repository as "git clone https://github.com/maximoskp/BSc_Seminar_AudioProg.git".

3. Any time you want to refresh the content of the repository, navigate to its folder, created in "repos", and type "git pull".
